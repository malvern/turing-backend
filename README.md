# Turing Backend Challenge
Overview
In this challenge, you will build the backend of an e-commerce system which allows users to search, add items to their shopping cart, create orders, and checkout successfully.
Given a database in MySQL (Github), you will need to implement the backend. Note that our challenge templates for the backend come already setup to use the Turing MySQL database.
Please feel free to use whatever frameworks/languages you feel most comfortable using. We offer challenge templates in some languages that we have high demand for (Node.js, PHP Laravel, ASP.net, and Python Django). We have fewer customers interested in engineers skilled in other technologies, but they still exist and we can match you if you do exceptional work in this project.
Any advanced techniques, tools, frameworks used in the code will also give you bonus points. Please add notes in the readme file so we can easily find and evaluate them.
Our customer companies have very high standards for software engineers, so please do your best possible work here to impress them.
